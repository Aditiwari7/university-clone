                        recognizing the
                        importance of Navigational Electronics to the country and the specific needs of the
                        Department of Civil Aviation and the Indian Air Force, decided to create a national centre for
                        expertise in this area. Proposals were invited, and the one submitted by the Department of
                        Electronics and Communication Engineering, Osmania University was selected. Thus, the
                        Research and Training Unit for Navigational Electronics(NERTU) came into being
                        on 1st April, 1982 as a sponsored project of the DoE. It continued to enjoy this status until
                        September 1992.

                        the Government of Andhra Pradesh has made it as permanent establishment, a research centre
                        of Osmania University by funding its recurring expenditure. The first Advisory Committee
                        (1982-1987) was headed by the former President of India, Bharata Ratna Dr. A.P.J. Abdul
                        Kalam, who was then the Director of Defence Research Development Laboratory (DRDL),
                        Hyderabad. Today, NERTU is the focal point for research and training, in the frontier areas of
                        Navigational Electronics in India. It is the first University centre to work in the area of
                        Global Positioning System(GPS) and GPS Aided Geo Augmented Navigation(GAGAN) System.
                        Dr.A.P.J.Abdul Kalam referred the “Development of Signal processing algorithms for NAG

                        Osmania University is a collegiate public state university located
                        in Hyderabad, Telangana, India. Mir Osman Ali Khan, the 7th Nizam of
                        Hyderabad, issued a firman calling for its creation on 29 August
                        1917. It is the third oldest university in southern India, and the
                        first to be established in the erstwhile Kingdom of Hyderabad.
                        <br />

                        was the first Indian university to use Urdu as a language
                        of instruction, although with English as a compulsory subject. As of
                        2012, the university hosts 3,700 international students from more
                        than 80 nations.

                        Minister, emphasized the need to establish a university in Hyderabad
                        with Urdu as the medium of instruction, "as it is the language of
                        the widest currency in India". On April 26, 1917, the Nizam of
                        Hyderabad Mir Osman Ali Khan issued a firman to establish the
                        Osmania University.

                        university began functioning in 1918 in a building
                        adjacent to the Nizam College at Basheerbagh. Arts and theology were
                        the only two faculties offered, and the first batch consisted of 225
                        students and 25 faculty members.

                        The government invited Patrick Geddes and Edwin Jasper to set up a
                        permanent campus of the university. Geddes surveyed prospective
                        locations and presented his report in 1923. Jasper drew up the
                        building plans and the Nizam laid the foundation stone for the
                        campus on July 5, 1934. After Jasper left Hyderabad, the state
                        architect Zain Yar Jung supervised the construction of the campus.
